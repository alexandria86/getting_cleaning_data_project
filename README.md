This is a repo for the submission of the course project Getting and Cleaning data.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 
This repo includes the following: 
1) a tidy data set as an output of transformations applied to raw data.
2) run.analysis.R script which is used to create an output file tidy.data.txt
2) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that have been performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 
3) README.md
The above files fully explain how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
